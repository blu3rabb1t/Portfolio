        Odysseus’s adventures on the Road of Trials and in the Belly of the Whale in Books 9-12 demonstrate his internal conflict between Kleos and Nostos. When Odysseus is telling one of his adventures on the Road of Trials in Book 9, he says, “I sacked the town and killed the men. We took their wives and shared their riches equally among us” (Wilson 9.41-43). Odysseus is sacking the town and taking their riches because he is looking for an adventure to undertake so that he can gain glory and fame. The sacking of the town reveals that Odysseus cannot decide between Kleos and Nostos, which is his internal conflict because Odysseus is trying to gain Kleos (glory) by sacking the town while at the same time trying to achieve Nostos (returning home). While in the Belly of the Whale, Odysseus’s adventures demonstrate his internal conflict between Kleos and Nostos by showing conversations that help resolve that conflict. During Odysseus’s journey to the Underworld, which is the Belly of the Whale, Odysseus talks with his mother and wants her to “tell me too about my father and the son I [Odysseus] left behind” (Wilson 11.173-174). When his mother tells Odysseus of the news, “Sharp pain pierced deeper in me [Odysseus] as I cried” (Wilson 11.209). Odysseus is asking his mother about his family because he cares about them and regrets not spending enough time with them, as he begins to cry after his mother talks with him. Odysseus’s discussion with his mother resolves his internal conflict between Kleos and Nostos because before the conversation, he wanted to go on adventures to seek fame (Kleos), but after the conversation with his dead mother, he feels inclined to return home (Nostos) because he cares for his family and wants to spend the time he has left with them. Odysseus’s sacking of the town and his conversation with his dead mother reveals his internal conflict between Kleos and Nostos by showing how Odysseus changes during the Road of Trials and in the Belly of the Whale, from pursuing glory and fame (Kleos) to choosing to return home and settle down (Nostos).
