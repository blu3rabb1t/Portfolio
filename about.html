<p>Chaos theory explained simply (kinda):
    This theory was discovered when meteorologists tried to predict the weather. After a certain number of days, the equations they used would result in different results even if you put the exact same numbers in. There were too many variables and too many things to account for, so even if you put the same variables in, the result will always be chaos. But, humans have figured out that even in chaos, things tend to happen in some sort of pattern. Basically, if you have a pendulum and you let it go at a certain point, and there’s no air resistance and stuff, it’ll keep on going in a loop and it never ends. That’s how some things are and we can predict the entire future of it. But for chaos, its a little different. Say for example, you have a town with 10K people and they have a grocery store. Then, another 10K people come, and they need other grocery store. That is what you would call, stability, and we can predict what happens, the grocery store stays there. But lets say you have the same 10K people, but instead of people coming, you now have 3K people leaving the town. The grocery then doesn’t make enough profit, so it shuts down. But the people need a grocery store, so the demand is high, that is what you call, an attractor. So another grocery store comes, but still doesnt make enough profit and it shuts down as well, and the cycle repeats. This is instability trying to find stability. That is basically what chaos is. This theory was discovered when meteorologists tried to predict the weather. After a certain number of days, the equations they used would result in different results even if you put the exact same numbers in. There were too many variables and too many things to account for, so even if you put the same variables in, the result will always be chaos.The unstable will always try and find stability, but in this case, it never will and the cycle goes on and on and on. Just like our society, we try to find peace, but never will, and the cycle goes on and on and on. 

Hypothetically, once everyone in the U.S is granted equal rights, women, lgbtq+, black and minorities, what happens after that? The world isn’t perfect, i think many people believe that if that happens, we’ll all be peaceful, but i think not. When one rises, the other falls, that’s how this world works. Take for example, BLM, if they get all their rights and the government make sure they get all the proper education and get good careers and make money, the others will get neglected. They can only focus on one thing at a time, so while they focus on the blacks, the whites and others will be somewhat neglected and fall below blacks. Then the point comes where people will be talking about white lives matter since they are not getting the attention and money from the government. Peace is not an option, rather it is a goal or an ideal we all strive to get at, but we will never get it due to the way the world works, or rather because of sin, but i rather not bring religion into this thought for now. Relating to the chaos theory, our societies are complex structures that can’t go together neatly. Like any form of chaos, there’s an attractor which our societies can relate to. For societies or the world, the attractor would be peace. The chaos theory states that you can find patterns in the unpredictable. The many variables that society has makes it impossible to predict what happens next, but everything ends up in a relative pattern. For societies, there are times of peace, which in turn make things unpeaceful because people are never satisfied, and striving for satisfaction, we create peace again, and the cycle repeats, but never once does it happen the exact same way it happened before. This defines chaos. Newton: once something is at motion, it will stay at motion, until another force stops it. Society is already moving along and changing, and there is no stopping, nor changing, nor predicting what happens. We can only predict as to what might happen due the chaos theory and attractors, but we are never certain of what might come. We as humans also do not have the power to stop society from moving along, another greater force can only do that. We will never be contempt with what we have, and right now, many people are striving for equality, and in turn they think it will create peace. They fail to realize that real equality, just like communism, is an ideal, like peace, and it will never happen because of how this world works. When you apply a force, an equal and opposite reaction is there. When one is satisfied, the other will not be. When we spend more time and money on, for example, the lgbtq community, the more the straight community will be neglected and ignored. Then, the lgbtq and black communities will have more rights than whites and straights since they get more money and more attention, and more care. Chaos is inevitable once something with so many variables is set into motion. There is no predicting what will happen and it will never stop because we as humans do not possess the power to stop it. The world has forever been at chaos and it will still be at chaos no matter how hard we try. Times of peace will come, it is what we strive for, but it will not stay.
